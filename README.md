## Description
    This game allows two users to compete in a dice rolling game. Each users roll values are accumulated co-currently with each 
    roll. However, if a user rolls a 1, the score is discarded and he/she is forced to pass the turn to the other player. The 
    second player consequently rolls the die till he/she scores a 1 or decides to hold his/her values. When a player decides to 
    hold, they pass their turn to the other player with their cummulative score being added together unless they had rolled a 1.
